## How do I update the maps?

To update any of the maps, we have our Illustrator files available to download from [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vg22hm3euf1c1a8/AACf3K7j7Q4_mJ7MEhcVDET6a?dl=0).

## I want to submit a Pull Request

After you have finished your new feature for the project, and you have toughly tested for bugs. You may submit a pull request for review. Make sure you follow the checklist below.

  * The feature/bug fix improves the user experience
  * Your code and feature/bug fix is well documented
  * If you update any of the maps, include the updated Illustrator files in your request. *Please note that the Illustrator file is not to be in the repository.* Attach the files to the pull request or link to the files. We want to allow future contributors the ability to use the most updated maps.
  * Title the request something that appropriately describes your feature.
  * Keep the repo organized. We do not want clutter in the repository, so before submitting a request remove any unnecessary files.

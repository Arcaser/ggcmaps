okay so potential list of instructions

To use Gwinnett Grizzlies Maps:

First, the whole campus map is displayed. There is a search bar with a open menu button on the far left, and the far right is the current building you are viewing and the current floor number. There is 3 zoom buttons in the bottom right. You have a few options.

If you want to view a specific building, click on it. You will know it is clickable by hovering over the building in question because it will darken as the mouse hovers on it.

Next, after selecting a building, you will now see the inside of the building including rooms, hallways, doors, labels, restrooms, and elevators. Rooms that are labeled that are clickable will show a lighter shade of green. Clicking on a room highlights it yellow.

To view an alternate floor, click on the far right drop-down and choose your desired floor.

An alternate method of navigating through the campus is using the search bar. The search bar can accept a building letter followed by a room number (i.e. A1290). You can either press enter after entering the room number or hit the search icon itself. If the same building is desired, you may enter a room number without a letter, which assumes again that it is in the same building.

The menu button opens another alternate method of navigation. The choices are campus, each building, and hot links to certain common school services or popular areas.

To zoom in or out, you have a few options depending on device:

For computer, mouse wheel may be scrolled up for zooming in or down for zooming out. In addition to this, at the bottom right, there are a plus sign (+) for zooming in, a reset button to restore the default view of the current map, and a minus sign (-) for zooming out.

For mobile device or laptop track-pad, pinching away from a center point in between two fingers yields a zoom-in at that center area. Pinching towards a center point yields a zoom-out in that center area.
